This directory contains source files in kleio notation collected in the Calendário obituário de São Bartolomeu de Coimbra [14th and 15th centuries] that is one of the oldest obituaries preserved for a Portuguese collegiate church, this document projects us into mental pictures and structures of thought, of living time and religion fundamental to the understanding of Western civilization. In turn, the identification of the deceased to be celebrated daily in the church of São Bartolomeu de Coimbra and the property bequeathed by them, for the maintenance of the funeral ceremonies, allows us to observe that parish, its space and its population, for over two hundred years.
